**Project Euler Problem 2**

Please note: I am solving these problems as I teach myself Python, therefore these earlier solutions will not be as advanced or efficient as my later solutions.

<em>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4000000, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</em>

````
num1 = 1 # 
num2 = 2
fib = 0
sum = 2 # 

limit = (int(input("Enter limit: ")))
while sum <= limit:
   fib = num1 + num2
   if fib % 2 ==0:
    sum += fib 
   num1 = num2
   num2 = fib 
print (sum)

**Output: 
Enter Limit:4000000
