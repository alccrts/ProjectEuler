# projecteuler

This is an ongoing collection of the program code I write as I solve the Project Euler challenges.  

I have used Python, which I am currently learning via the University of Helsinki (MOOC Intro & Advanced Progamming).  This likely means my earlier written code will not be as advanced or efficient as my later solutions as I develop my coding skills. 

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve." - https://projecteuler.net/.
