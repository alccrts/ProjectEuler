 # Python Projects

This is an ongoing collection of the program code I have written to solve the Project Euler challenges.  

I have used Python, which I am learning via the University of Helsinki (MOOC Intro & Advanced Progamming).  As I develop my programming skills, my earlier written code will likely not be as advanced or efficient as my later solutions.

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve." - https://projecteuler.net/.
